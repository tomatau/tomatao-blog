# Hello, world!

Today I have created a blog. This blog. Tomatao Blog. All of the source code for tomatao blog is available [on github](https://github.com/tomatau/tomatao-blog). This blog, tomatao blog, will strive to produce concise posts the share insights into software development by Thomas `tomatao` Hudspith-Tatham.

## Impressive

When you view any page on this blog, you will download at least 150KB of JavaScript (JS). All of said JS is completely **pointless**. The blog will work just fine without it.

There are a whole host of practices used to build this blog, and literally, no functionality. You may even struggle to find how to get back to the list of posts after clicking on one.

### I like the cut of your jib!

Stay tuned for more posts!
